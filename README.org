#+TITLE: Doom Emacs config with Vim keybindings

* How to install Emacs on MacOS
** 1. Install Emacs Plus from Homebrew:
*** Prerequisites:
#+begin_src fish
# required dependencies
brew install git ripgrep \
# optional dependencies
brew install coreutils fd \
# Installs clang
xcode-select --install
#+end_src
*** Install Emacs:
<https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus>
#+begin_src fish
brew install d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus \
    --with-no-frame-refocus \
    --with-xwidgets \
    --with-imagemagick \
    --with-native-comp \
    --with-c9rgreen-sonoma-icon
#+end_src
Create the Emacs.app alias in =/Applications=; adapt the version number in the file path if necessary:
#+begin_src osascript
osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to make alias file to posix file "/usr/local/opt/emacs-plus@29/Emacs.app" at posix file "/Applications" with properties {name:"Emacs.app"}'
#+end_src
The Emacs.app maybe blocked due to MacOS security mechanisms. Apply the following commands to the actual app file (not to the alias in the =/Applications= directory):
#+begin_src fish
xattr -c /usr/local/opt/emacs-plus@29/Emacs.app
#+end_src
#+begin_src fish
sudo codesign --force --deep --sign - /usr/local/opt/emacs-plus@29/Emacs.app
#+end_src
* How to install the Doom Emacs distribution
** Check the requirements and perform the installation
https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org
#+begin_src fish
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.emacs.doom
~/.emacs.doom/bin/doom install
#+end_src
Add the directory =~/.emacs.doom/bin= to the =PATH= variable:
Issue the following command if you're using fish as your shell ...
#+begin_src fish
fish_add_path -U -v ~/.emacs.doom/bin
#+end_src
... and/or add the following line to either =~/.zprofile= (Zsh), =~/.profile= or =~/.bash_profile= (Bash):
#+begin_src shell
PATH="$HOME/.emacs.d/bin:$PATH"
#+end_src
* How to install my Doom Emacs config
After Doom Emacs has been installed, synced and started at least once, make sure to delete any of =~/.doom.d= and =~/.config/doom=:
#+begin_src shell
rm -rf ~/.doom.d && rm -rf ~/.config/doom
#+end_src
Very likely, only first one of these directories exists, hence the command may display an error, but succeed nevertheless.

Clone the Git repository into the right place, either:
